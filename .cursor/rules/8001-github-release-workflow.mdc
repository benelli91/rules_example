# GitHub Release Workflow from Milestone

## Context
- User provides GitHub milestone URL requesting release generation
- Keywords: "release", "generate release", "milestone", "create release"
- Prerequisites: Updated develop branch, GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- Uses GitHub CLI exclusively for GitHub connections

## Requirements
- 🔍 **Detect milestone URL pattern**: `https://github.com/*/milestones/*`
- ✅ **Validate develop branch**: Ensure develop is up-to-date with origin
- 📝 **Request version name**: Ask for version in format `v1.x.x`
- 🌿 **Create release branch**: Generate `release/v1.x.x` from develop
- 📋 **Generate CHANGELOG entry**: Extract milestone data via GitHub CLI and summarize changes
- 🔧 **Use GitHub CLI only**: All GitHub interactions via `gh` commands

## Examples

<example>
User: "Generate release from https://github.com/owner/repo/milestones/5"

Response:
I'll generate a release from the provided milestone. First, what version number should I use? (format: v1.x.x)

Once confirmed, I'll:
1. Validate develop branch is updated
2. Create release/v1.x.x branch from develop
3. Fetch milestone data: `gh api repos/owner/repo/milestones/5`
4. Extract closed issues/PRs from milestone
5. Generate CHANGELOG.md entry with milestone summary
6. Commit changelog updates to release branch
</example>
