# Changelog Documentation

## Context
- When documenting changes in CHANGELOG.md
- For release notes and version tracking
- Following Keep a Changelog format with Semantic Versioning

## Requirements

### üìã **Structure Format** (Keep a Changelog Principles)
- Use `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` for released versions (ISO 8601 date format)
- Use `## [Unreleased]` at top for tracking upcoming changes
- Order versions from newest to oldest (latest version first)
- Include semantic version format: `[MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH]`
- Make versions and sections linkable
- Group same types of changes together
- Display release date for each version
- **Add GitHub links at bottom**: Link versions to releases/compare URLs for easy navigation

### üè∑Ô∏è **Entry Categories** (Keep a Changelog Standard)
- **Added**: New features and capabilities
- **Changed**: Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Now removed features
- **Fixed**: Any bug fixes
- **Security**: In case of vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates (project-specific)
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure changes (project-specific)

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Writing Style**
- Use past tense for all entries
- Start entries with action verbs (Added, Modified, Enhanced, Fixed, etc.)
- Be specific and concise
- Include context for business impact when relevant to KYC enforcement
- Reference domain layers when applicable (enforcement, notification, configuration, etc.)

### üîß **Technical References**
- Reference specific components: handlers, services, repositories
- Include HTTP status codes when relevant (HTTP 204, HTTP 500, etc.)
- Mention database-related changes explicitly
- Reference configuration changes by environment when applicable

### üîó **GitHub Links Standard**
- Add reference links at bottom of changelog file
- Format: `[version]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/prev...version`
- Use `compare` for version diffs and `releases/tag` for initial releases
- Include `[Unreleased]: ...compare/latest...HEAD` for current development

### üö® **Antipatterns to Avoid**
- Never use commit log diffs as changelog entries (full of noise and merge commits)
- Don't ignore deprecations - always list what will be removed
- Don't use confusing date formats - stick to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Avoid generic entries like "bug fixes" without specifics

### ‚ö° **Special Cases**
- Mark yanked releases: `## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-15 [YANKED]`
- Always mention breaking changes prominently
- Include migration notes for deprecated features when relevant

## Examples
